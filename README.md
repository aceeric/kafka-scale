### TODO

-) Need: three deployments: read/chunk, compute, results
-) If I just add a servicemonitor will kube-prometheus see it?
-) Grafana dashboard - how to inject it into the kube-prometheus stack
-) How to add Strimzi monitoring to existing kube-prometheus stack
-) Test with one broker and two - I think the net.Addr only supports a single endpoint...

### DONE
-) Add podman push image to appzygy in Makefile
-) Add a manifests dir
-) Created and tested a Pod
-) look at the redhat quay thing
