# This is a simple smoke test. It can be used as longs as Kafka is running. It simply lists the Kafka
# topics and then exits. The Pod is set to not restart. After deploying the pod, view the pod logs. If the logs
# show no errors and a correct topic list, then you've validated Kafka connectivity from the kakfa-scale
# app in cluster.
